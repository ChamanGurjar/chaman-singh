    Nutritap has their own vending machines that user can operate via mobile app. In this project I wrote the functionality related to User login, access based on roles, Kiosk configuration, sales capturing, payment confirmation, order for a - user, location or kiosk, coupon functionality and referral functionality etc.
    Nutritap also fills these kiosks/vending machine also wrote the functionality to capture the filling details like which nutritap filler is filling what product and how many quantities for which machine and location. Also developed a flow to capture the incoming and outgoing of orders/products on warehouse level.
